Student Presentation Topics
---------------------------

The final assignment for students in Dynamics of Complex Systems is a formal presentation before the class on recent research relevant to the topics discussed earlier in class. Each student is assigned either one paper or two closely related papers to read and study. Students should prepare to be "experts" on the paper(s) assigned for their talks; each presentation should last approximately one hour with time alloted for questions.

1.  Reactivity, Stability, and Plankton (2 Presentations)
